## About

The EDCTheme is used to bring customizability unlike ever seen before. You can easily save color themes for your ship, set the ship's theme at the click of a button and even have the app automatically set the theme at a specific time!

This app was created for people who care about the aesthetic of their ship and like to modify it's colors frequently. Or those who just want to use the app once and have it set the colors for them automatically at a specific time of the day.
