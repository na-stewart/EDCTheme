## About
This app was created for people who care about the aesthetic of their ship and like to modify it's colors frequently. Or those who just want to use the app once and have it set the colors for them automatically at a specific time of the day.

It is very easy to use and I hope you really enjoy the application! I always could use feedback to feel free to submit a pull request and leave a star.

## Download

Please download the Version with permissions if your elite dangerous directory is within program files
otherwise download the version without permissions. 

The app needs permission in order to modify anything within the Program Files directory.
